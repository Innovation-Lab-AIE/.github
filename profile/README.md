# Advanced Industrial Engineering Innovation Lab

The **Advanced Industrial Engineering Innovation Lab** aims to communicate knowledge about emerging technologies and provide hands-on experiences with them. These technologies are set to fundamentally transform the way we work and live.  

The lab is open to students of **TH Rosenheim** as well as employees from regional companies. It also serves as a hub for research and development projects and technology transfer. Students gain practical experience during their studies, developing projects and demonstrators under the guidance of **Prof. Dr.-Ing. Andreas Straube**. This allows them to engage with cutting-edge technologies and collaborate with companies, potentially serving as a springboard for future employment opportunities.

Thanks to a research project, the lab has been equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, providing opportunities to gain knowledge in areas such as **artificial intelligence, neural networks, and data acquisition in production systems**, along with hands-on access to demonstrators. In addition, the lab covers **augmented and virtual reality**, offering a wide range of devices, applications, and examples. With our collaborative robot, students and researchers can explore automation applications that enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

We would like to extend our special thanks to **Landkreis Traunstein**. Thanks to a generous contribution of €9,000 in Q4 2023, a new research position was established in the lab, now held by **Maria Quinteiro Perosa**.
